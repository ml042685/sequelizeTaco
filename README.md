# Eat-Da-Tacos (Sequelize)

Homework Week 17 - Eat-da-tacos


## **Description:**

* Eat-Da-Tacos! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of tacos they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a tacos's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each taco in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.



This application demonstrates a simple full stack application featuring the use of Node, Express server, MySQL and HTML templating using Handlebars. Also introducing Sequelize and replacing ORM.
